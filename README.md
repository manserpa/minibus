# Large scale designing of public transport networks

This repository was originally a clone from the original [MATSim Minibus Contrib](https://github.com/matsim-org/matsim-libs/tree/master/contribs/minibus),
which was developed by [Neumann, A (2014)](https://svn.vsp.tu-berlin.de/repos/public-svn/publications/vspwp/2011/11-15/trb_paratransit_submitted_12nov11.pdf).

It is extended for the specific use-case of reproducing and optimizing the formal public transport network of the city of Zurich. The results have been
published in Manser, P., Becker, H., HÃ¶rl, S., & Axhausen, K. W. (2020). [Designing a large-scale public transport network using agent-based microsimulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965856420305668). *Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice*, **137**, 1-15.
